# uniBuddy

While at university, I often struggled with organizing my modules effectively. I wanted a tool that could **centrally automate the organization process**, keeping everything neat and tidy in one place.  

Finding information for each module was difficult because course outlines were written in different formats and styles. On top of that, lecture PowerPoint slides were inconvenient to manage, as they had to be downloaded one by one and were often lost in the downloads folder of my computer.  

That’s why I decided to develop **uniBuddy** – a web application designed to help students **leverage the power of AI** to keep everything organized and enhance their workflow.  

uniBuddy is a **Next.js** web application.  
Its key feature is that it allows users to **upload course outline** and automatically process the information and display the key informations in an easily interprabel manner. In addition, it automatically takes out alll the topics in each week it also allows students to provide study assistance, organization, and insights.
